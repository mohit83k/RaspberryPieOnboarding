# RaspberryPieOnboarding

## Summary
Task was to create a toy Car using Raspberry Pi. We had to implement a pen holding mechanism so that we can write
via movement of car. 
move.py contains the instructions to move the car with key board keys. Keys are hard coded for **W S A D** to mimic
Need for Speed game controls :)

## Harware
Raspberry Pi and l293d motor driver
